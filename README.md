# Web-Backend-Takehome-Coding-Challenge

Back-End coding challenge building a Raffle App with Node.js, Express.js and PostgresSQL.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- PostgresSQL installed
  - Or you can use a managed PostgresSQL database from [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) (5mins setup, no installation of Postgres needed)
    - Read [How to create a Postgres Database in ElephantSQL.com](./how-to-create-a-postgres-db-in-elephansql.md)
    - You can sign up with a Google or GitHub Account
- A PostgresSQL Client installed to connect to and set up your database
  - **Mac** [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) or [Psquel](http://www.psequel.com/)
  - **Mac/Windows/Linux** [Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/get)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/) installed to test out your endpoints.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Express App and give it a name. This will be for your back-end server.
   - You may use the [express-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator) to create your express app scaffolding
2. Setup a Postgres Database locally (or in ElephantSQL) according to the Technical requirements below.
3. Complete your back-end server according to the Technical requirements below.

## Technical Requirements

Your job is to create a back-end server and database for a Raffle application. Users are able to:

- Create raffles
- List all raffles
- Add participants users to raffles
- Draw a winner from a raffle

### Recommended file structure

```bash
back-end
  ├── app.js
  ├── db/ # folder with your db setup and queries
  ├── package.json
  ├── README.md
  └── routes/
      └── raffles.js
```

>\* Does not have to match exactly


### Database

You should have at least two database tables to store the information for this app. The diagram below shows tables `users` and `raffles` and their relationships.

### Server

Create an express server with the following endpoints.

#### Endpoints

##### GET `/raffles`

Retrieve all raffles.

##### POST `/raffles`

Post a new raffle. The JSON body to send in the request should include a `name` and `secret_token` property.

Example POST body: 

```json
{ 
  "name": "My first Raffle", 
  "secret_token": "s3CrE7" 
}
```

##### GET `/raffles/:id`

Retrieve a single raffle by its id.

##### GET `/raffles/:id/participants`

Retrieve all user participants of a raffle.

##### POST `/raffles/:id/participants`

Sign up a participant to a raffle given a raffle id. The JSON body to send must include `firstname`, `lastname`, and `email`.
`phone` is optional

`email` should be unique to protect from the same user signing multiple times for the same raffle.

Example body: 

```json
{ 
  "firstname": "Jane",
  "lastname": "Doe",
  "email": "jdoe@email.com",
  "phone": "+1 (917) 555-1234",
}
```

##### PUT `/raffles/:id/winner`

Selects the winner at random picking from the users that are signed up for the raffle specified by id and return it. A winner will be picked only if the request body includes a secret token that matches the token used when the raffle was created via POST `/raffles`.  If the token is not present or doesn't match return an error message.

Example POST body:

```json
{ "secret_token" : "s3CrE7" }
```

If drawing a winner is successful return the winner user. For example:

```json
{
    "id": 2,
    "raffle_id": 1,
    "firstname": "John",
    "lastname": "Snow",
    "email": "jblizzard@email.com",
    "phone": null,
    "registered_at": "2021-05-22T15:43:52.647Z"
}
```

**Note:** If a winner is attempted to be picked multiple times don't allow it and return the existing winner instead. Multiple identical PUT request should have the same result, this is the definition of [idempotence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20PUT%20and,placing%20an%20order%20several%20times.).

#### Bonus Endpoints

##### GET `/raffles/:id/winner`

Retrieve the winner of a raffle.

##### GET `/raffles/:id?active=<false|true>`

Using a query param `active`, return raffles that are "active" (`active=true`), meaning they don't have a winner yet or raffles that already have a winner (`active=false`)
